# Link shortener exercise

This is an exercise in making a simple link shortener.

Run from node and all dependencies.

If you have docker:
`bash launch_app.sh`

It'll shorten any text, not validating links exist or are valid.

There's no check for duplication of the shortened URL because it's very very unlikely there'll be any overlap.
